# GSAP 3 Express

This repo contains the code created whilst following the GSAP 3 Express course from [Creative Coding Club](https://www.creativecodingclub.com/).

The course explores the basics of GSAP to get beginners up and running with it. Unlike other GSAP courses, this doesn't create a fancy follow along project. Instead it splits things into more manageable pieces so you can really understand what the code you are producing is doing.
